# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# React Portfolio Lab


We're here for a reason, and that reason certainly ain't hearing Jeremy's lame dad jokes

We're here to enter the world of professional software engineering and coding. There are a few things that we will need to enter the field: A resume, a LinkedIn, and of course, a solid Portfolio site. 

We are going to spend the next block working in conjunction with Outcomes to help build up our portfolio sites.

This is *not* something you are going to finish up in 2 hours. In fact, it something that you are going to continue working on and updating even after you deploy it online.

Take your time to plan out some wireframes and think of how you want to style your site


### Requirements

There is no standard way to build up a Portfolio, but we'd *highly* recommend having components for a Nav bar to get around the site (We will build this up more in our Router I lesson!), an About Me, which may or may not be your landing page, a component for your Resume, a Contact page, one to hold your Projects in, and a component for each project (You can add more as you build more of course!)

We want you to take your time on this and not rush something so important. Having this "complete" will not be required as a deliverable for homework, we just want to see the initial set up, plus your prep and wireframes. 

A professional, beautiful, and deployed Portfolio is going to be required to complete Outcomes at the end of the course, and for your job search process, so take your time in planning and building up what you want to do, take the time now to get the first steps set, and create something you can really show off and be proud of!
