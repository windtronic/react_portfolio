            I'm passionate about all things related to technology, and I'm constantly exploring new trends and techniques in software development.
            As a software engineering student, I've gained experience in a variety of programming languages
            including [HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, JQuery, Sequel, Python 3.11].
            </p>
