      <h3>
        Hello there! My name is Toni and I have a passion for creating things
        that live on the internet. From web development to software engineering,
        I am constantly exploring new trends and techniques to enhance my
        skills. As a full stack software engineer, I have gained experience in various
        programming languages, such as ES6 Javascript, HTML5, CSS, React.js,
        Node.js/Express, JQuery, and Python.
      </h3>

      <h3>
        In addition to my software engineering background, I also have a strong
        foundation in complex systems and creative problem-solving, thanks to my
        background in electrical engineering focused on wind turbine technology,
        and experience as a veteran of the United States Army. I strongly
        believe in the power of collaboration and enjoy working with others to
        tackle complex issues. I am committed to continuous learning and
        constantly seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills.
      </h3>

      <h3>
        With my unique blend of technical expertise, problem-solving abilities,
        and leadership qualities, I believe that I can be a valuable asset to
        any team. I am eager to continue my professional growth and take on new
        challenges and opportunities.
      </h3>

      <h3>
        In my free time, I enjoy playing guitar and writing new songs. I also
        love fire performing (when it's warm enough!), dancing, exploring
        musical arts, hanging out with family and friends, traveling, and trying
        new foods.
