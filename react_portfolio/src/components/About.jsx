      <h3>
        Hello there! My name is Toni and I have a passion for creation and learning.
        From web development to software engineering,
        I am constantly exploring new trends and techniques to enhance my
        skills. As a full stack software engineer, I have gained experience in various
        programming languages, frameworks, and libraries.
      </h3>

      <h3>
        In addition to my software engineering background, I also have a strong
        foundation in complex systems and creative problem-solving, thanks to my
        background in electrical engineering, wind turbine technology,
        and experience as a veteran of the United States Army. I strongly
        believe in the power of collaboration and enjoy working with others to
        tackle complex issues. I am committed to continuous learning and
        constantly seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills.
      </h3>

      <h3>
        In my free time, I enjoy playing guitar and writing new songs. I also
        love fire performing (when it's warm enough!), dancing, exploring
        musical arts, hanging out with family and friends, traveling, and trying
        new foods.
